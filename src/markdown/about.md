i-Sense Flu uses Google search data to estimate influenza-like illness (flu) rates in England.
Daily flu rate estimates reflect on data from the past 7 days. Models are trained using GP consultation data (aggregate,
anonymised) obtained from the [Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP)](https://www.rcgp.org.uk/). This
website is supported by the EPSRC IRC project [i-sense](https://www.i-sense.org.uk/) (Early-Warning Sensing
Systems for Infectious Diseases) and a Google Research Sponsorship.

<!--Note that regional scores (i.e., everything but the scores for "England") are still under development.-->

> **Note:** All estimates on this website should be considered as experimental (see the website's disclaimer below).
